# DESCRIPTION

This application is a WIP tool for modders to help streamline the process of finding information and creating. bl3hotfix mods. If you would like a the package with the executable of this program with minimal hassle, go to my presonal repository of this: https://github.com/TrevorSTroxel/BL3-Hotfix-Manager/tree/main.<br>
If you are reading this from the official BL3 modding page, then there will only be my code here. You can still make it work if you know what you are doing, but I would just reccomend getting my release to make your life easier.

# NOTE

I am a college student, so I will not be able to work on this all the time, but I will when I have free time.<br></br>
Feedback and tips for how to improve this program are appreciated. I will get to them as soon as I can.
If you are curious about something or have a question about something, the best way to contact me is via my email, which you can find in my profile, or send me a message on Discord.

# USEAGE

I now have a magical .exe file that does everything that is needed in order to get the program working.  Go into the `dist` folder and click on the __interface__.exe to use.
